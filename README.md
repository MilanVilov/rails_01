The goal is to write an algorithm that returns the availabilities of a calendar depending on openings and the scheduled events. The main method takes a start date as input and looks for the availabilities over the next 7 days.

They are two kinds of events:

opening, are the openings for a specific day and they can be recurring week by week (e.g. every monday starting from a certain date)
appointment, times when the doctor is already booked
The entire product specifications are described in the provided test files. In other words, the test files describe the behavior we expect from the algorithn.


Write an algorithm that passes all the tests we provided
Think beyond those provided cases, specifically:
Add tests to make sure all nominal cases are covered
Add tests to cover all edge cases you can identify
